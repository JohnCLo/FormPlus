Demonstration project that extends Google Forms to allow image uploads as canvas blobs from web enabled mobile devices. Fully utilizes Google Spreadsheets as a image and text "database"<br/><br/>

Built around crowdsourced child homelessness reporting prototype (ZhiZheWang). Unfortunately, China blocked most Google services when the prototype was being rolled out and subsequent development never took off. Take a look around for some interesting image compression techniques utilized in HTML canvas. <br/><br/>
